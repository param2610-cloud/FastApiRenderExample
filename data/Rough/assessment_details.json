Links the essential/desirable competencies for a specific job with an individual’s competency potential. Provides an overall Match (or fit) Score useful in ranking/sorting candidates for selection \r\nand/or development (e.g. Talent Audit).  It provides a highly visual profile of a candidate's strengths and limitations against identified required competencies. Includes a summary table that enables prioritisation of action planning for development of critical competencies for an individual (by tabling Competency Potential against Job Importance for the role). It includes highly descriptive statements about a candidate's strengths and development  needs/limitations. \r\nThe extended report versions include proposed competency-based interview questions \r\nto enable probing of specific situations in which the candidate might have \r\ndemonstrated critical job behaviours. \r\n  \r\nThe PJM Report is designed for use by line managers and HR professionals in selection and \r\ndevelopment situations. It is valuable for identifying an individual's overall fit as well as likely areas of \r\nstrength and weakness relative to their behaviour at work. \r\n \r\nIn a selection context, this information can be used: For making interviewers aware of the areas that may need further probing. As a basis for suggesting and creating relevant interview questions. For identifying the relative strengths and weaknesses of shortlisted candidates.",

The Contact Center Simulation provides an opportunity for candidates to interact with simulated customers in a contact center environment. Designed to measure a candidate’s ability to listen attentively to the customer, take ownership of customer issues, resolve issues, navigate to find information, and enter information accurately, the Contact Center Simulation is intended to measure how a candidate will respond in a variety of customer situations and assess the candidate’s computer skills in a contact center setting. The behavioral tests in this solution are intended to measure the candidate’s learning potential and the tendency to meet goals and work hard, even when faced with obstacles. Collectively, the assessments in this solution measure a wide range of important skills, abilities, and behaviors for entry-level contact center roles.\n\"Please note that for Simplified Chinese version the audio is available in both Mandarin and Cantonese.\"",
